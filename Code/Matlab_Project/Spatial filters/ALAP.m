function [data_filtered] = ALAP(data)
% Laplacian performs a spatial filtering following the Adaptative Laplacian method

% The input data should be organised in a nxm matrix where n is the number
% of channels and m is the number of samples
%
% In the param structure, the sample frequency is saved
% 
% The ALAP function returns the filtered EEG signals
