function [data_filtered] = ICA(data)
% Laplacian performs a spatial filtering following the Independent Component Analysis method

% The input data should be organised in a nxm matrix where n is the number
% of channels and m is the number of samples
%
% In the param structure, the sample frequency is saved
% 
% The ICA function returns the filtered EEG signals
