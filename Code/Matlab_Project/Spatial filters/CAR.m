function [data_filtered] = CAR(data)
% CAR performs a spatial filtering following the Common Average Reference
% Method
% Use as
%   [freq] = ft_freqanalysis(cfg, data)
% The input data should be organised in a nxm matrix where n is the number
% of channels and m is the number of samples
% In the param structure, the sample frequency is saved
% 
% The CAR functions returns the filtered EEG signals
